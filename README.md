Freeware Open-Source Game (I don't know who built it)
Credits to the owner of this DOS game.
==========================================
Camel is a game in which you are traveling in the Desert trying to make it across the plane over 200 miles. Pigmies will be chasing you for their supper. You must make it across the plane without being captured by the Pigmies. Be careful! A lot of activity goes on in this Desert!
The package contains Source Code in C and Euphoria, and an executable so you can begin pplaying right away! A Screen Reader is required to play; a DOS-style Window is used.
